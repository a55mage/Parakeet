Thank you for using this version of Parakeet

>The app has been tested with:
>Pebble 2 HR
>Amazfit Bip
Visual studio will take care of most problems by downloading a ton of libraries, but you have to manually activate the bluetooth component from the project settings

How to install:

1. Install the certificate, selecting local machine and Third party Root
2. Install the app
3. In case the installer asks for more certificate, install the certificate in other different paths

How to use Parakeet:

1. connect your Bluetooth device to your pc using the windows settings
2. launch parakeet
3. If your device has a continuos heart rate function or a "fitness" mode, activate it
4. select your device from the in-app device list
5. you can choose a TCP port to send the heart rate values, the address is always localhost
6. click connect and wait for the values
